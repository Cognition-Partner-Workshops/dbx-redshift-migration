# Construct coverage

Redshift construct → *expected* Lakebridge outcome (hypothesis, not fact) →
observed (filled by migration sessions) → fix pattern. "review feedback
updates the playbook": when a session hits a mismatch, it records the observed
outcome and the fix that made `make validate` pass.
